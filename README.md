## choose-your-own

A little text-based adventure. Still in its infancy, no idea where it's going yet.

Started 1/11/2025.

SUMMARY:
Text adventure with custom parser, that takes word-elements from the input string and breaks them into word-instances based on format and verb rules, then acts on them accordingly. Has items with item states (open/locked/broken/etc) and dynamic descriptions, events (on item pickup, on item state change, on run-start and so on) with effects and state-dependent messages, locations with items, dynamic descriptions based on present items + location state.

All hand authored (as if you couldn't tell by looking at the code).

No story yet, just a scaffolding for a relatively complex world and interactions which a story can be built on.
